This is my second attempt at Udacity's 4th Frontend Web Developer assignment! It uses a fairly basic backend API to send and receive data in real-time, as well as webpack as a build tool, and Jest for testing!

Instructions go as follows:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open in a text editor
- Open the terminal and run the command "npm run prod" for production (or "npm run dev" for development mode).
- Finally, run "npm start", and the application should be up and running.

To use the application, simply enter in a URL that contains an article, and the app will respond with information about the article, utilizing the MeaningCloud Natural Language Processing API.
